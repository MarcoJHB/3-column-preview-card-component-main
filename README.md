## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this activity. Got better with centering, as well as using links as buttons instead. Also - CSS VARIABLES! I'm in love with them now. Would like to move to SASS soon, but these do the job.

```css
:root {
    --bright-orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
    --dark-cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
    --very-dark-cyan: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
    --transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    --light-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
    --dark-gray:hsla(0, 0%, 17%, 0.644);
  }
```

### Continued development

I'd definitely like to focus more on the use of variables as well as SVGs.
